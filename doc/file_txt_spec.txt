TXT
{
  TXT_HEADER (28B)
  {
    [2B] unsigned short : number of parts (always 0x05)
    [2B] unsigned short : count of PART_HEADER
    [4B] unsigned int   : offset to PART 1 (english)
    [4B] unsigned int   : offset to PART 2 (dutch)
    [4B] unsigned int   : offset to PART 3 (french)
    [4B] unsigned int   : offset to PART 4 (spanish)
    [4B] unsigned int   : offset to PART 5 (japanese)
    [4B] unsigned int   : file size (or offset to EOF)
  }
  PART 1-5 (xB)
  {
    PART_HEADER (offset to the first entry / 2B):
    {
      unsigned short [2B]: offset to the X entry from the start of part_header offset
    }
    STRING_ENTRIES \0 terminated (xB) - XOR encoded part! See below.
    {
       All strings entries to the end of the part sould be XOR in one pass!
       XOR each byte with byte-1 to get the correct char.
       For the first byte of the STRING_ENTRIES block, use 0xF5 as byte-1.
